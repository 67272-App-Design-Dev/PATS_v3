# 67272_PATS_v3

This is a basic Rails app that was built as a class demonstration. This version focuses more on using ReactJS, enhancing the user experience with Ajax, and adding search functionality.

The class is Application Design & Development (67-272) and is for students in [Information Systems at Carnegie Mellon University](https://67272.cmuis.net). We have posted this code on [github.com](https://github.com/67272-App-Design-Dev) in a public directory so that (a) it is readily accessible to students and (b) that students will get a little familiarity with github.com.

This project does require the use of several gems to work properly. Check the Gemfile to see which gems are used. This project also assumes the user is running Ruby 3.1.x since that is what is used in the course.

## Running

To get this running after cloning the project repp, you need to take the following steps:

1. Install yarn with the command `npm install --global yarn`. Verify it's installed with the command `yarn -v`

2. Run `bundle install` and then `rails db:populate` to get the react-rails gem and create and populate the database.

3. Install the React packages with `yarn install`

4. Start rails and react with `rails s; yarn start`

# testing

yarn add --dev jest

yarn add --dev jest babel-jest @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react react-test-renderer

yarn add --dev @testing-library/react

yarn add -D jest-environment-jsdom

yarn add msw --dev

yarn add --dev react-select-event

yarn add --dev whatwg-fetch

## Setup

This version of the project requires only a sqlite3 database. After cloning this repo, install all gems with the `bundle install` on the command line. To set up the database and populate it with realistic sample records, run on the command line `rake db:populate`. The populate script will remove any old databases, create new development and test databases, run all the migrations to set up the structure and add in the triggers, and then create 240 owners with over 450 pets and several thousand visits. (Every run will generate a different set of data and because of the large numbers and the callbacks used, it will take a few minutes.)

To verify the model and controller tests are functioning, simply run `rails test` on the command line. The SimpleCov gem will create a coverage directory with an index.html file in it; open this file in a web browser to see the coverage provided.

The populate script will also create a vet user to login into the system. The username is 'vet' and the password is 'yodel' -- a tribute to VeggieTales' [The Yodeling Veterinarian of the Alps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUkpE16b56g).

If you want to load the testing context into the development database, you can do the following:

1. if you have previously populated the database, drop it and rerun `rails db:migrate` to recreate a blank db.
1. open `rails console`
1. type `require 'factory_bot_rails'` (it will say 'false')
1. type `require './test/contexts'` (it will say 'true')
1. type `include Contexts` (it will say 'Object')
1. type in whatever context building method you wish (e.g., `create_animals`)

or...

you could just run `rake db:contexts` and let that script do it for you. ;)
